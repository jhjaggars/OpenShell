# KubeVirt guest init for OpenShell sandboxes (proof of concept).

# containerDisk from e2e/kubevirt/build-guest-image.sh). Modeled on the libkrun
# init (crates/openshell-driver-vm/scripts/openshell-vm-sandbox-init.sh) but
# for KubeVirt hardware:
#
#   /dev/vda  rootfs      (containerDisk carrying the dm-verity hash tree;
#                          the initramfs mounts the verified read-only lower
#                          and stacks a tmpfs overlay as the writable root —
#                          in-session writes are RAM and every boot starts
#                          from the verified image)
#   /dev/vdb  config disk (cloudInitNoCloud ISO rendered from the driver's
#                          bootstrap Secret; shell-sourceable user-data)
#   workspace  virtio-fs share backed by the per-sandbox PVC (filesystem
#              PVCs are not exposed as block disks by KubeVirt), mounted at
#              /sandbox and seeded from the image on first boot
#
# After setup it runs the static openshell-sandbox boundary as a child
# process; PID 1 stays the init so it can power off the guest when the
# boundary exits.
